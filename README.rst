yahtzee-simulation
-------------------

The goal of this project is to establish a test bench for testing different
theories in playing Yahtzee.  For example, is it better to go for point in
the bottom column or in the top trying to get the bonus.  As a by-product I
will also try to make a program that allows the user to play Yahtzee.
